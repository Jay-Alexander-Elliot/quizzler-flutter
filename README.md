# Quizzler - A True/False Quiz App

## Project Overview
Quizzler is an educational project that is part of a comprehensive Flutter course on Udemy. This application is designed as a True/False quiz app that provides users with a series of questions and allows them to select answers. The app keeps track of the users' scores and presents a final tally at the end of the quiz.

The primary focus of this project is to enhance the understanding of Flutter and Dart programming concepts. The Quizzler app serves as a practical implementation of the following key learning topics covered in the course:

1. **Flutter Framework Basics:**
    - Introduction to the Flutter framework and setting up the development environment.
    - Understanding the structure of a Flutter application and the role of widgets.

2. **Dart Programming Concepts:**
    - Lists: Usage of lists in Dart to store a series of questions.
    - Conditionals: Implementing IF/ELSE logic to handle user interactions and control the flow of the application.
    - Classes and Objects: Understanding the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Dart.
    - Class Constructors: Learning about constructors and how to use them in Dart for initializing class objects.

3. **OOP Principles in Action:**
    - Abstraction: Creating a Question class to manage the data model of the quiz.
    - Encapsulation: Ensuring that the inner workings of the classes are hidden from the rest of the application, exposing only the necessary functionalities.
    - Inheritance and Polymorphism: Demonstrating OOP principles through practical code examples.

4. **Building Functionalities:**
    - Building a Score Keeper to track and display the user's score.
    - Displaying Questions and Checking User Answers.
    - Progressing through questions and updating the UI dynamically.

5. **Code Challenges and Best Practices:**
    - Engaging in practical coding challenges to reinforce learning.
    - Learning and applying best practices in code structure and organization.

## Current State of the Project
As of now, the project's code is in a non-functional state due to outdated Flutter standards and requires refactoring and bug fixes. Given the time constraints as a student, I am currently unable to allocate the necessary time to update and repair the codebase. The intention is to revisit and rectify these issues as time permits.

The code for this project is available on GitHub and can be accessed through the following link: [Quizzler Challenge Final](https://github.com/londonappbrewery/quizzler-flutter-challenge-final).

## Learning Resources
For those interested in learning more about Flutter, Dart, and the principles of OOP, I highly recommend exploring the following resources:
- [Flutter Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs)
- [Dart Programming Language](https://dart.dev/)
- [rFlutter Alert Package Documentation](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/rflutter_alert)

Stay tuned for future updates, and happy coding!
